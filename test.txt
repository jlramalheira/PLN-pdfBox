Abstract
This study measures the magnitude of transaction costs incurred by milk producers in their contractual relations with dairy processors in two
different coordination mechanisms: centralized contracting through a marketing board and decentralized bilateral contracting. Interviews and
surveys were conducted to estimate transaction costs faced by producers marketing through the Que´bec milk marketing board in Canada and
bilateral contracts in England and Wales in the United Kingdom using the measurement methodology of the cost of exchange. Our results show that
the relative magnitude of transaction costs incurred by producers across both settings is quite low, which indicates that both hybrid coordination
mechanisms minimize transaction costs in the dairy sector. However, results from the bilateral contracting setting indicate a strong heterogeneity
of transaction costs levels among farmers. In that respect, the milk marketing board and its institutional setting would act as a collective insurance,
pooling transaction costs and sharing them among producers. Our analysis leads to recommendations on bilateral contracting.

1. Introduction
For the last two decades, vertical linkages in the value chains
of many agrifood sectors have tightened. This phenomenon is
at the origin of a growing interest among scholars and prac-
titioners for questions related to vertical coordination and the
organization of transactions. In Canada, the vertical coordi-
nation of products between producers and their downstream
partners is done through marketing boards in many agricul-
tural sectors. In the province of Que´bec, for instance, 90% of
the total agricultural proceeds were marketed through market-
ing boards in 2008.1 Canadian marketing boards are generally

defined as “legislatively specified compulsory marketing insti-
tutions which perform any of the functions of marketing on
behalf of the producers of a particular agricultural commodity”
(Veeman, 1987, p. 992).
There is a large number of studies on the economical effi-
ciency of boards (Barichello, 1981; Beck et al., 1994; Fulton
and Tang, 1999; Richards, 1996) but to the best of our knowl-
edge, it seems that none of them have focused on the role of
these organizations on vertical coordination or their influence
on transaction costs. Some scholars have mentioned the poten-
tial advantages of boards in economizing on transaction costs
and rationalizing some marketing operations (Johnson, 2000;
St-Louis and Proulx, 1978; Westgren, 1994) but we are not
aware of any empirical study that has been done to clarify the
issue. The recent interest in vertical coordination efficiency is a
good occasion to revisit the performance of marketing boards
from a different perspective. In their study on vertical linkages
within agrifood value chains, Hobbs and Young (2001) suggest
analyzing the role of these organizations in the vertical coor-
dination of transaction. The authors make the hypothesis that
if marketing boards do not have market power and thus no ef-
fect on market prices, then rents obtained by producers through
boards could come from boards’ ability to “lower transaction

costs in the value chain and to pass these cost savings back to
farmers in the form of higher returns [. . .]” (Hobbs and Young,
2001, p. 62).
The objective of this article is to contribute to the debate
on whether or not marketing boards have the capacity to de-
crease transaction costs faced by producers with an evaluation
of the magnitude of transaction costs incurred by producers
when selling their milk through a marketing board. Since all
milk produced in Canada has to be marketed through boards,
bilateral contracts prevalent in England and Wales are exam-
ined for comparison purposes. That way, our article overcomes
a transaction costs economics’ basic selection problem. Gener-
ally, one only observes costs for the organizational arrangement
chosen, and so direct comparisons with costs of an alternative
organization are impossible (Masten et al., 1991, p. 3). Unlike
earlier studies, this article compares two existing alternative co-
ordination mechanisms evolving in similar technological, eco-
nomical, and institutional environments. Using transaction cost
economics (TCE) (Coase, 1937; Williamson, 1985) and devel-
oping a methodology based on previous similar works (Benham
and Benham, 2005), this study identifies transaction costs as-
sociated with alternative marketing channels in order to: (1)
estimate the magnitude of transaction costs incurred by pro-
ducers and (2) explain the disparity among marketing channels.
Results show that transaction costs incurred by Que´bec pro-
ducers are slightly lower than English producers but also, that
the relative magnitude of transaction costs across coordination
mechanisms remains very low. The genuine advantage of mar-
keting boards, as far as transaction costs are concerned, would
rather lie in their ability to pool transaction costs among pro-
ducers so as to act like a collective insurance against circum-
stantially high transaction costs. Indeed, our analysis shows
that bilateral contracting leads to a strong heterogeneity of
ex post transaction costs magnitudes, which may threaten the
survival of dairy farms facing major contractual hazards. Al-
though applied to specific contexts, our study may bring some
useful insights to the current policy trend in Europe. As a mat-
ter of fact, considering the growing interest of the European
authorities toward contracting as a regulation tool in substitu-
tion to dairy quotas, our results highlight the possible future
producers’ challenges and the importance of an adequate insti-
tutional framework to minimize producers’ transaction costs in
a bilateral contracting setting.
2. Coordination mechanisms
The two coordination mechanisms considered in this arti-
cle are the milk marketing board of the province of Que´bec
(Canada) and bilateral contracts in England and Wales (Great
Britain). The Canadian and British cases provide appealing
comparative grounds since both countries have comparable
public institutions and similar milk industries. They show rel-
atively similar technology levels, production modes, consump-
tion patterns, and market structures. Both dairy regions are

milk. In Great Britain, they account for 21% and process 87.5% of total milk.

supported by well-developed extension services, research and
development institutions, and union organizations. Table 1 dis-
plays some of the socioeconomic characteristics of the milk
sector in both regions.
The general institutional framework of both countries is also
similar since Canada has adopted most British public institu-
tions. The Constitution of Canada, the parliamentary and judi-
ciary system, and the commercial law are all derived from the
British ones. However, when it comes to the milk sector, impor-
tant differences appear. In Canada, all milk producers are con-
strained to sell their milk through provincial marketing boards,
which negotiate contracts with milk buyers. To be effective,
these boards have to be framed by a specific institutional set-
ting. In the United Kingdom, producers were also constrained
to sell to a marketing board until 1994. Milk marketing boards
were, however, dismantled after a decrease in their efficiency
following a series of institutional and organizational changes
imposed by the European Union to fit the Common Agricul-
tural Policy in 1973 and by the introduction of quotas in 1984 at
the European level (Doyon et al., 1999). Since then, producers
contract directly with private processors or cooperatives to sell
their milk.
2.1. The milk marketing board in Que´bec, Canada
Better known in the economic literature for their horizontal
coordination effects than their vertical coordination activities,
marketing boards are granted with delegated powers from the
state allowing them to intervene in the exchange of raw agri-
cultural products between producers and purchasers. For many
agricultural sectors in Canada, these organizations constitute the
exclusive and mandatory contractual intermediary between pro-
ducers and purchasers of agricultural products. The legislation
enabling marketing boards provides for statutory safeguards
A. Royer/Agricultural Economics 42 (2011) 171–182 173
against boards acting contrary to the public interest through the
creation of a public regulatory body supervising boards’ activi-
ties. This authority also acts as a quasi-judicial specialized court
when disputes among parties arise. The Que´bec milk market-
ing board, created in 1981, displays a wide array of functions
ranging from promotional activities to negotiation, centralized
selling, and supply management.
The Que´bec milk marketing board alters substantially the
individual process of milk marketing at the producer level. In-
stead of contracting directly with a dairy processor, producers
delegate all their contractual operations to a producer board
composed of elected producers and professional staff. Market-
ing milk outside the board is illegal and is liable to lead to
a dissuasive fine. Dairy cooperatives and processing investor-
owned firms, hereafter called private purchaser, use a similar
delegated configuration. Thus, three main agents take part in
the contractual process: the producer board, the organization
representing private purchasers, and the organization represent-
ing cooperative purchasers. The producer board contracts with
both purchasers’ organizations simultaneously, which implies
that only two contracts are signed to coordinate the total milk
production of the province of Que´bec. Both negotiated con-
tracts are signed for a three-year period but are often extended.
Contracts have to be approved by the regulatory body to be-
come legal and enforceable. This contractual arrangement is
atypical since parties contracting are not the economical agents
themselves but the organizations representing them (Fig. 1).
Transaction costs generated by milk transactions are therefore
basically borne by the three organizations aforementioned.
2.2. Bilateral contracts in England and Wales, United
Kingdom
Since the dismantlement of the milk marketing board in 1994,
milk marketing in England and Wales is done through bilat-
eral contracts between producers and purchasers. Producers
can choose to sell their milk through three alternative market-
ing channels: direct contracting with a milk purchaser; direct
contracting with a milk purchaser supervised by a direct sell-
ing group (DSG); and contract with a cooperative as a member
(Franks, 2001, p. 633). Since processing capacities of cooper-
atives are limited, they sell their milk surplus to private pro-
cessors. There are thus two types of contractual relations down
the dairy chain: contracts between producers and private proces-
sors, and contracts between cooperatives and private processors
(Fig. 2). We will not take into account the latter relation since
it belongs to a secondary channel and it concerns only 27%
of total milk marketed. Moreover, in this article, we seek to
compare two significantly different organizational forms while
cooperatives’ organizational nature is similar in many respects
to marketing boards.
Contracts signed between English producers and proces-
sors are said to be evergreen since they are automatically re-
newed until one party wants to terminate the contract. Contracts
are usually developed by purchasers and offered to producers.
These latter are thus contract takers. Some contracts between
producers and private buyers are negotiated through a DSG.
The main role of these groups is to rationalize producers’ and
processors’ communications, and simplify the renegotiation of
contracts. No statistics on their prevalence are available to ap-
preciate their importance. Franks (2001, p. 632) notes, however,
that approximately 12% to 15% of the producers would nego-
tiate their contracts through dairy groups.
3. Theoretical framework
3.1. Transaction costs
TCE makes the assumption that exchanges are not costless.
Transaction costs are the costs resulting from property rights
transfers between agents. Transaction costs theory is based
on what Williamson (1985) calls the discriminating alignment
hypothesis. This hypothesis states that depending on the di-
mensions of transactions (asset specificity, uncertainty, and fre-
quency) and behavioral assumptions (bounded rationality and
opportunism), economical agents will choose institutions, or-
ganizational forms, and transactions that minimize the cost of
exchange.
One of the major critics against TCE concerns the gap be-
tween remarkable theoretical developments and the paucity of
results in terms of direct measurement of transaction costs.
Very few studies focus on evaluating the magnitude of trans-
action costs and some scholars even consider this deficiency
as a theory’s strength (Saussier and Yvrande-Billon, 2007). By
using propositions based on characteristics of transactions and
not directly on the level of costs, the transaction costs the-
ory escapes a hazardous comparative exercise of governance
structures, which is not relevant in many cases. Other scholars
persist in developing methodologies for measuring transaction
costs because, to cite a widespread axiom in the business world,
“what gets measured, gets managed” (Benham and Benham,
2005, p. 373; McCann et al., 2005, p. 527).
Beyond this debate, it remains that the lack of empirical
evaluations of transaction costs is nevertheless not surprising.
Researchers that try to evaluate directly the magnitude of trans-
action costs have to overcome many difficulties.2 First, there
is no theoretical consensus over what are precisely transaction
costs (Allen, 1991; Hobbs and Kerr, 1999). The many coex-
isting definitions “offer powerful conceptual insights, but they
have not been translated into widely accepted operational stan-
dards” (Benham and Benham, 2005, p. 368). Second, estimating
transaction costs is complicated by the difficulty of separating
transaction and production costs. Third, if transaction costs are
very high, some transactions might not take place. Opportunity
costs of alternatives would preferably have to be taken into ac-
count and these costs are not easily identifiable or quantifiable.
2 For a more complete description of transaction costs estimations difficul-
ties, see Benham and Benham (2005).

Finally, some agents, because of their characteristics or identity,
do not face the same transaction costs. These differences may
be difficult to identify by researchers. This list of difficulties
is extended if we consider the efforts that have to be under-
taken to create original data, since transaction costs are usually
not collected in governmental census or in firms’ standard ac-
countancy practices. The lack of transaction costs empirical
estimates on their relative magnitude and variation across set-
tings is puzzling. Filling this deficiency could surely improve
transaction costs empirical research and it would broaden our
understanding of various coordination mechanisms.
3.2. Transaction cost measurement in the literature
The lack of theoretical consensus over what are transaction
costs has unsurprisingly given birth to a heterogeneous collec-
tion of empirical works in terms of their measurement. Some
studies consider transaction costs as the difference between
prices paid by the buyer and received by the seller. This method-
ology is especially suitable for the financial and transactional
sectors. The most well-known piece of work done in this area is
probably the article written by Wallis and North (1986) on the
analysis of the U.S. transaction sector. Our present research falls
within another research program, which considers transaction
costs as the “value of resources used in locating trading partners
and executing transactions” (Wang, 2003, p. 2). Many works
of this research program have been made in the environmental
and ecological economics fields (Falconer, 2000; Kuperan et
al., 1998; McCann and Easter, 1999; McCann et al., 2005; Met-
tepenningen et al., 2009). These studies focus on evaluating the
magnitude of transaction costs associated with the conception
and implementation of diverse public policies. Another set of
studies are investigating the costs of transactions that private
traders face. Benham and Benham (2005) and their research
team are carrying out a series of studies on the cost of exchange
(COE) based on a standardized methodology that they have
developed.
Defining the COE as “the sum of production costs and the
specific transaction costs faced by the individual,” studies re-
lated to this research program have attempted to evaluate the
costs of starting up a new business, obtaining a business tele-
phone, buying an apartment, or importing a physical asset
(Benham and Benham, 2005, p. 371).
A. Royer/Agricultural Economics 42 (2011) 171–182 175
When it comes to the measurement of transaction costs gen-
erated by interfirm relations in the agricultural sector, studies
are relatively scarce.3 The study that resembles most what we
intend to do here is the one done by Gabre-Madhin (2001) who
measured the costs of labor time required in searching trad-
ing partners and the opportunity cost of working capital during
search for grain traders in Ethiopia. Her results demonstrate that
transaction costs incurred during the information search period
represented 19% of total transaction costs. Although applied to
a developing country with a different institutional setting, this
article suggests that transaction costs faced by private traders
can be significant and that they may affect their competitive-
ness. Our study contributes to this neglected literature while
focusing on the comparison of two distinct hybrid coordination
mechanisms used in developed countries. In the following sec-
tions, we develop an analytical framework and a methodology
for evaluating empirically the magnitude of transaction costs
incurred by producers when selling their milk through different
coordination mechanisms.
4. Analytical framework for milk marketing
4.1. Determinants of transaction costs
Milk producers face numerous transaction costs when con-
tracting with their downstream partners of the value chain but
very few works have investigated the possible determinants of
transaction costs in the case of milk marketing. There are even
fewer empirical studies that examine their relative importance.
Previous studies (Compres Lopez, 2007; Dieye, 2006) and our
empirical observations of the sector indicate that transaction
costs in milk marketing arise mainly from various uncertainties
and the temporal specificity of milk transactions. Partners may
engage in costly activities in order to attenuate uncertainty, thus
generating transaction costs.
Milk producers face different types or sources of uncertainty
in raw milk transactions: price uncertainty, behavioral uncer-
tainty, and information asymmetry. Producers face price un-
certainty since they may not know in advance what price they
will receive before final milk delivery. Producers also face be-
havioral uncertainty from unbalanced negotiating power due to
a generally oligopsonistic market structure in the milk sector
and temporal specificity due to the perishable nature of milk,
which translate into contractual commitment and enforcement
uncertainties. The partners’ bilateral dependency created by
transactions temporal specificity is an important determinant
of transaction costs in the presence of potential opportunis-
tic behaviors. Finally, producers have to deal with information
asymmetry over quality grading and classification since dairy
processors usually perform these tasks.
3 A few papers have estimated transaction costs in the agrifood sector (see
Hobbs, 1997; Key et al., 2000) but the methodologies used are different from
what we intend to do in this article.
Based on the determinants of transaction costs in milk mar-
keting, we make the hypothesis that the milk marketing board,
by reducing producers’ environmental and behavioral uncer-
tainty, should be more effective in minimizing transaction costs
faced by producers than bilateral contracts. As a matter of fact,
the Que´bec milk marketing board sets a range of prices to
negotiate with buyers, which decrease price uncertainty; the
collective negotiation decreases the uncertainty related to the
unbalanced partners’ bargaining powers; the board has cre-
ated diverse mechanisms to monitor buyers’ utilization of milk,
mitigating information asymmetry over product grading and
weighting; and the regulatory body operates a payment guaran-
tee program that protects producers against buyer insolvency.
The collective coordination mechanism should therefore have
a greater producers’ transaction costs minimization’s capacity
than bilateral contracting.
4.2. Transaction costs components
In order to compare transaction costs’ magnitude of both
marketing channels under consideration, a quantitative mea-
sure of transaction costs is needed. Although there is no of-
ficially recognized methodology for examining the magnitude
of transaction costs, the recent works of Benham and Benham
(2005) propose a standardized methodology that many authors
have applied to comparative analysis. We decided to use this
methodology because it is the one that best suits our needs
for measuring transaction costs incurred by private agents in an
exchange. In that methodology, a subset of the total costs gener-
ated in a transaction is examined. This subset, designated as the
COE, Cijkm, is defined as “the opportunity cost in resources—
money, time and goods—for an individual with characteristics
i to use a given form of exchange j to obtain a good k in an
institutional setting m” (Benham and Benham, 2005, p. 370).
Also, similar to the methodology developed by Benham and
Benham (2005), our analytical framework does not account for
indirect transaction costs related to the creation of institutions
framing commercial exchanges, the development of a reputa-
tion, personal networks, or specific abilities necessitated by the
transaction. On the one hand, these costs are often very difficult
to quantify, and on the other hand, we make the hypothesis that
these costs offset each other in the comparison. Moreover, the
cost of developing the framing institutions such as courts in Eng-
land and the marketing board legislation in Canada have most
likely been paid off since their inception. We are aware that this
is a strong and arguable hypothesis and that our results must be
interpreted accordingly, but measuring these costs would have
been a colossal and often impossible task to perform.
In order to structure our analysis, we divided the milk mar-
keting contractual transaction into three main direct transac-
tion costs items: information (I), negotiation (N), and moni-
toring/enforcement (M) costs. Information costs occur ex ante
to an exchange and include information search on products,
trading partner, and market conditions. Negotiation costs also
176 A. Royer/Agricultural Economics 42 (2011) 171–182
occur ex ante and consist of the cost of realizing the transaction,
which may include the cost of the negotiation process, contract
redaction, etc. Monitoring and enforcement costs occur ex post
to the signature of the contract and consist of monitoring, rene-
gotiation, maladaptation, termination, and enforcement costs.
5. Methodology and analysis
5.1. Data collection
When transposed in an empirical investigation, the method-
ology used in this work suggests to choose and define some
transaction in detail so that one can measure all resources used
to carry out the transaction. In both marketing channels investi-
gated, milk is sold to purchasers on a contractual basis, be it in-
dividual or collective. Therefore, we consider the contract used
in both settings as the analytical unit. Data collection has been
conducted in a two-step procedure. The first step, conducted
during the fall 2006 and 2007, consisted of interviewing repre-
sentatives from key organizations involved in the marketing of
milk and collecting information about the contractual process.
This first step enabled us to outline the transactional process
by determining what happens and when, who is involved and
how does it proceed. Given the fact that the marketing board’s
income statement is available, we could have estimated trans-
action costs based on internal organization expenses. However,
this method would not have been accurate enough since ex-
penses consist mainly in costs that are not transaction costs
per se such as lobbying and milk promotion costs. We thus un-
dertake the measurement of transaction costs specifically gen-
erated when the marketing board contracts with its partners.
The second step consisted of collecting data about resources
spent during the transactional process determined in Step 1. In
the case of the marketing board setting, producers may incur
transaction costs in basically two contractual relations. First,
there is the delegated contractual relation between the market-
ing board and the purchasers. Second, there is the representation
relation between producers and the marketing board. Transac-
tion costs at this level are observed when the marketing board
validates and transmits requests from producers encountering
problems with their milk deliveries to purchasers, as well as
when there are litigations between producers and the board.
In order to investigate transaction costs magnitude, we inter-
viewed, during fall 2007, key marketing board employees in-
volved in the contracting process concerning time and monetary
expenses they incurred for each cost item during the last con-
tracting period.
For the bilateral contracting setting, we undertook a tele-
phone survey of 62 milk producers in England and Wales
throughout spring and fall 2008. A few socioeconomic and
contractual statistics from our survey are presented in Table 2.
The sample was drawn randomly from a list of dairy producers
in the United Kingdom Yellow Pages. Interviews with a DSG
and a cooperative were also conducted.

There are a number of limitations to the transaction costs
direct measurement methodology. Some costs may have been
omitted because they were difficult to identify or quantify such
as opportunity costs. However, our two-step methodology re-
duces potential omissions since it allowed us to have a good
understanding of the two marketing channels and their poten-
tial sources of costs. Another limit concerns the use, in studies,
of perceptual items evaluated ex post. A number of authors
in the management literature have noted that retrospective re-
searches are subject to inaccuracies due to the fallibility of
informant (Huber and Power, 1985; Miller et al., 1997). Our
work does not escape this limitation but we tried to reduce
its impact by combining more than one source of information
when possible and by only using data from recent years (<5
years). Moreover, in the case of England and Wales, we believe
that individual producers are more disposed to better remember
their own business experience than civil servants or employees
for instance. Besides these limits, the measurement of direct
transaction costs remains a relevant exercise. It opens the black
box of the contracting process’ and allows us to pinpoint many
contracts’ strengths and flaws that other methodologies cannot
provide.
Time data collected were translated into monetary terms. In
the marketing board setting, we differentiated salaries accord-
ing to the position held by the staff interviewed. Per-day wages
of 350 Canadian dollars (CAD) for technician, CAD600 for
professional, CAD1,500 for a lawyer, and CAD500 for elected
producers were used. These wage data encompass the salary as
well as work material costs.4 In England and Wales, we used
the 2005 report of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farm-
ers on costs of farmers’ own labor. We considered contracting
as a farm management task and thus used a per hour average
wage of £13.70 (RABDF, 2005). As for the time horizon delim-
itation, we considered a five-year period, from 2003 to 2008.
This period corresponds to the last marketing board contracting
period.5 In order to compare the magnitude of costs in both

supposed to end in 2006. However, this period was extended and both contracts
were still valid in 2008.

5.2. Results
5.2.1. Information costs
Before negotiating a contract, sellers must usually first col-
lect some information on the transaction such as prices, selling
conditions, and potential purchasers and second, get in touch
with the chosen partner. In the bilateral contract setting, pro-
ducers incur price and purchaser discovery costs. Source of
information are numerous: newspaper, word of mouth, Inter-
net, and dairy advisors. Results from our survey indicate that
most producers were either approached by a particular buyer or
obtained information from word of mouth. These two sources
of information imply very low transaction costs. The steps to
get in touch with an eventual buyer vary from a simple phone
call, to individual meetings with the purchaser and assisting to
sessions organized by the buyer.
In a marketing board, parties do not have to search for a
contractual partner or a price. The contracting partner is known
in advance and prices are partly regulated; traders are given a
range to negotiate. Some professionals have mentioned during
interviews that time spent on information search is not very
important. On the other hand, the development of a negotiation
strategy is important and may generate substantial costs. The
development of a strategy consists of determining problems
encountered in the former contract, locating new stakes, and
developing an initial negotiation strategy.
Table 3 shows the information costs magnitude obtained from
our calculations. In the marketing board setting, we added up
transaction costs amount for each type of cost generated over

the five-year period, and divided it by the number of producers
in 2007 (7,133 producers) in order to get an average magnitude
of transaction costs faced by an individual producer. Empty
boxes indicate that no costs are associated with the transaction
costs description specified. In the bilateral contracting setting,
we added individual time data collected and divided them by the
number of respondents to get an average amount for an individ-
ual producer. We multiplied results obtained by the hourly wage
to obtain a monetary data when needed. For instance, the 62
English farmers interviewed spent a total of 94.92 hours in in-
formation searching, which average 1.53 minutes per producer
(94.92/62 producers) and represents £20.97 (1.53× £13.70). We
only took into account transaction costs incurred after 2003 so
as to keep only costs incurred during the five-year period. Some
producers that have been contracting for more than five years
with the same buyer might incur very low or no transaction
costs at all.
5.2.2. Negotiating costs
Once the information search step is finished, parties begin
to negotiate contractual terms and enter the negotiation phase.
This second step differs quite a lot among marketing channels,
as shown in this article. In the milk marketing board, parties
meet within a negotiation committee composed of the three or-
ganizations aforementioned (marketing board, cooperative pur-
chaser organization, and private purchaser organization) and
supervised by representatives of the Que´bec Ministry of Agri-
culture and the regulatory body. The negotiation process can
be divided in three phases: negotiation preparation, negotia-
tion sessions, and ex post sessions analysis, which includes the
elaboration of a counterstrategy. Contract negotiation may turn
out to be very laborious since parties are engaged in a trilat-
eral negotiation, which introduces important strategic aspects
and adds to the task’s complexity. Many negotiation sessions
are necessary to achieve a final agreement. Twenty-two hours
were necessary to conclude contracts signed in 2003. As the

negotiation process leads to consensuses, parties draft the con-
tract. Once written, proposed amendments are submitted to the
negotiation committee for validation before the final draft is
written.
During the negotiation process, dissensions can occur. When
disagreements arise, parties are first invited to use a process of
conciliation. If this stage fails, parties go into arbitration, a more
time- and resources-consuming solution. Costs are, however,
controlled by the use of the regulatory body as an arbiter. If
the decision reached by the regulator is not satisfactory for one
of the parties, resort to the Que´bec provincial Superior Court
is possible. This solution is nevertheless much more expensive
for the parties, which must then call upon legal services.
In England and Wales, private and cooperative purchasers
propose contracts to producers. The result is a “take it or leave
it” proposition, where the terms of the agreement are set by
the purchaser and offered to producers. We expect negotiation
costs to be very low in that setting. Moreover, purchasers assume
contract-writing costs. Direct-selling groups are not involved in
this contracting phase. Negotiation costs shown in Table 4 have
been calculated with the same methodology as the information-
phase costs.
5.2.3. Enforcement/monitoring costs
The monitoring of the collective contract in the milk mar-
keting board is carried out through four committees (negotia-
tion, technical, quality, and supply) created in order to make
regulated contracts more flexible.7 Renegotiations ex post can
prove to be very long and expensive for parties because of
the regulated nature of the agreement and the disputes’ settle-
ment process. Consequently, the law enabling marketing boards
prohibits ex post renegotiations. Adaptation to the institutional
environment translates into contract quasi-completeness: the
parties try to safeguard against all unforeseen possibilities ex
ante while inserting additional clauses in the contract at each
renewal. The role of committees becomes in that sense essential
for the good realization of the agreement, but also for transac-
tion costs minimization.
Most conflicts arising from the realization of the agreement
concern the divergences of interpretation on clauses and ap-
plication of the contract. When these situations occur, parties
are invited to undertake a good agreement procedure.8 If the
conciliation process fails, parties go into arbitration and follow
the disputes’ settlement process as described in the negotia-
tion costs section (Section 2). There have been two arbitrations
7 The negotiation committee involved in the negotiation process is also in-
volved in the supervision of the contract’s realization. The technical committee
makes sure that the technical aspects (dairy products classification, system
adaptation, and billing) of the milk transactions are well coordinated. The
quality committee is responsible for maintaining and improving the quality of
milk throughout the transaction. Finally, the supply committee is in charge of
coordinating the supply of milk between producers and buyers.
8 Objections of producers against purchasers are not directly conveyed to
them. They are initially subjected to the marketing board and if considered
relevant, the board notifies the purchaser.

that ended up to the Que´bec Superior court during the last five
years.9 Resort to the Superior Court can prove to be a quite
expensive solution for both partners. Also, there have been five
conflicts involving producers and their board over the same
period.
Monitoring and enforcing costs are not expected to be very
high for producers in England and Wales since they do not
have the bargaining power or the financial resources to safe-
guard their contractual arrangement in courts. Legal assistance
for producers that subscribed to the National Farmer Union
(NFU) legal assistance service is, however, available to partly
overcome this difficulty. Renegotiations do not occur frequently
since the purchaser can modify the price or the selling condi-
tions without the agreement of its suppliers. The main contrac-
tual hazards occurring during the ex post phase of the transaction
in England and Wales are dissensions over prices paid, notifi-
cation periods, changes brought to level the annual production,
cases of purchasers’ bankruptcies, and breaches of contract due
to processors’ fusions.10
Finally, some producers may want to terminate their contract
in order to change purchaser. The contract termination pro-
cess might imply penalties, compensation payments, or resort

to legal assistance. Termination costs consist in most cases of
writing a letter to the buyer in which they notify their will to
terminate the contract. In a few cases, producers mentioned that
they had to pay considerable penalties or compensations when
terminating their contracts. Since considering bonus losses as
transaction costs might be subject to debate, we decide to
present the results with and without these costs. When taken
into account, bonus losses rise up substantially the enforcement
phase costs over the five-year period. We computed the NFU
legal assistance services’ cost whenever producers used them.
The calculation procedure used to obtained transaction costs
magnitude in Table 5 is the same as the one used in previous
tables.
6. Discussion
6.1. Transaction costs calculations
The summary of our results and some additional calculations
are presented in Table 6. We calculated the total amount of
transaction costs incurred by an individual producer for both
settings over the five-year period.
The difference in transaction costs magnitude across coor-
dination mechanisms (US$17.92 < US$355.87/3, US$3701.03
with bonus losses) seems to be significant. These results corrob-
orate our insights on the potential ability of marketing boards

to decrease transaction costs. Moreover, although some trans-
action costs measures might be approximate, the importance of
the cost difference between the two settings allow us to con-
clude on the capacity of the milk marketing board to reduce
transaction costs faced by producers.
6.2. Contractual phases
A closer look at the magnitude of transaction costs at each
contractual phase reveals the strengths and weaknesses of both
organizational structures’ ability to minimize transaction costs.
In Great Britain, negotiation costs are the lowest transaction
costs with a share of 8.5% of total transaction costs. We ex-
pected the negotiation costs to be rather low in Great Britain
since there is no negotiation as such. Enforcement costs are the
highest costs with 80% of total costs (98% if bonus losses are
taken into account). The proportion of these costs is quite con-
siderable and consists mostly of enforcement costs or contract
termination costs if we consider bonus losses. Although En-
glish producers do not entail legal contract enforcement costs
since they consider courts too expensive, they engage in costly
private solutions.
In the marketing board setting, the lowest costs are infor-
mation costs with 16% of the total costs. These costs are low
since the marketing board forces producers to delegate their
contracting operations, which rationalizes the number of inter-
locutors and time required to search for a contractual partner.
The negotiation costs are the highest and account for 50% of
the total costs. Contract negotiation in the marketing board set-
ting implies developing negotiation strategies, which is a long
and costly process. Enforcement cost (34%), although lower
than negotiation costs, are according to market participants in-
terviewed, seriously increasing. Considering that these costs
may become higher in the future for producers selling their
milk through a board, and considering the proportion of these
costs in the bilateral contracting setting, we conclude that the
enforcement phase is definitely the weakest link of the contrac-
tual process in both coordination mechanisms. Policy makers
and authorities should therefore pay specific attention to these
costs in the future.
6.3. Relative importance of transaction costs
Although transaction costs seem to be lower in the market-
ing board setting, the relative magnitude of transaction costs
across organizational forms is nevertheless very low, which
challenges the actual transaction costs minimization effective-
ness of boards. Transaction costs account for 0.0017% of the
annual revenues of an average dairy farm in Que´bec and 0.039%
(0.4% when bonus looses are considered) in England and Wales
over the five-year period.11 The few studies that have measured
private transaction costs indicate that these costs are generally
considerable and that they are likely to affect agents’ compet-
itiveness. Our results indicate that transaction costs are quite
low in both coordination modes meaning that they should not
seriously affect the competitiveness of the dairy industry. This
result is somehow surprising since the literature is rather unan-
imous on the issue: “transaction costs matter.” Two reasons can
be given to interpret this result. First of all, the methodology
used to measure transaction costs and the difficulties associated
with measuring some costs might underestimate their impor-
tance, notably opportunity costs and indirect transaction costs.
Second, the low level of transaction costs might also mean that
both organizational forms considered are adequate to coordi-
nate raw milk transactions. Our results and observations lead
us to conclude that transaction costs have most probably been
underestimated in both settings but that they still remain very
low compared to less coordinated settings or other agricultural
sectors. The dairy sectors of both regions have reached a high
level of institutional, technological, and behavioral stability that
allows transaction costs minimization.
6.4. Heterogeneity among farmers
Considering this outcome, it seems that the main difference
between both settings would lie not in their respective capacity
to decrease transaction costs but rather in the heterogeneity of
11 The average revenue is based on the average values of prices, number
of cows per farm, and cow yields in 2006 in both regions with the follow-
ing calculation. In Que´bec: ($0.6424/liter × 53.3 cow× 7,549 liters/cow) =
CAD258,477 (Ageco, 2007). In England and Wales: (£0.1795/liter × 97 cow ×
6,815 liters/cow) = £118,659 (MDC, 2007).
A. Royer/Agricultural Economics 42 (2011) 171–182 181
transaction costs magnitude incurred by individual producers.
As a matter of fact, in bilateral contracts, the disparity of transac-
tion costs faced by each producer is quite large. Some producers
incur very low transaction costs, if not at all, whereas others face
very high costs. For instance, producers implied in contractual
litigations, which concerned 14 producers interviewed (23% of
our sample), had financial losses varying from £29 to £10,000.
Also, our survey reveals that 10 producers (16% of our sample)
had to incur contract termination costs varying from £200 to
£45,000. For these producers, transaction costs indeed matter.
Producers incurring high contract termination costs show sim-
ilar characteristics to the rest of the sample (150 cows; 7,355
liters/cow/year; 2.2 full-time workers), which does not allow us
to conclude on possible socioeconomic determinants of these
costs. This situation does not happen in the marketing board
setting. Marketing boards being a collective mode of coordinat-
ing transactions, they allow producers to collectively negotiate
the conditions of sale of their products, but also to pool the
totality of transaction costs among them. By doing so, market-
ing boards provide a transaction costs insurance for producers
against especially high ex post transaction costs.
7. Conclusion
Evaluating directly the importance of transaction costs is not
a widespread approach for analyzing coordination mechanisms
but it has the advantage of opening a black box that allows a
better understanding of where and how the main contracting
costs during the exchange process are generated. Knowing the
precise sources of transaction costs and their magnitude might
be useful for any agent that wants to improve the efficiency of
a specific coordination mechanism or assist a specific category
of economic agents. Our investigation demonstrates that by an-
alyzing in detail the dairy producers’ transactional process, we
could find that the main difference between marketing milk
through a marketing board and individual contracts in terms
of transaction costs was the heterogeneity of transaction costs’
levels borne by producers. While on average transaction costs
were relatively low across both settings, a few English produc-
ers incurred very high transaction costs that could eventually
threaten the farm’s short-term viability. This issue has recently
been very problematic for producers who had a contract with
Dairy Farmers of Britain Limited (DFoB) when the cooperative
faced serious financial problems and announced its liquidation
in June 2009. Members supplying milk to DFoB had to in-
cur very high transaction costs, notably the amount of their
May milk deliveries, which averaged £10,000 to £15,000 per
farm, and their investments in the cooperative, which approx-
imated £50,000 according to NFU estimates (House of Com-
mons, 2009). A farmer mentioned he had lost “circa £120,000
in terms of capital investment and bad debt,” and added “Ef-
fectively, it means that [. . .] I would have to work for two years
for nothing” (House of Commons, 2009, p. 27). In a market-
ing board setting, for instance, the payment guarantee program,
financed by all producers, acts as an insurance against such
transaction costs.
Considering the potential advantages of marketing boards
in reducing transaction costs and acting as insurance why are
contracts more widespread than boards? Before answering this
question, we must underline that our article does not pretend to
conclude on the overall transactional effectiveness of marketing
boards and that this issue represents potential further research
topics. For instance, transaction costs faced by buyers should
be assessed. Since marketing boards are producer-oriented or-
ganizations, it is not obvious that marketing boards can lead to
a reduction of transaction costs borne by processors. Indirect
transaction costs can also be more deeply investigated, notably
the cost of using the regulatory body disputes’ settlement ser-
vices in the marketing board case. There are at least two major
reasons that explain the prevalence of contracts over market-
ing boards. First, marketing boards need a specific institutional
framework to be effective and this legislative setting requires
support from politics as well as set-up costs that public lead-
ers are no longer willing to assume considering their political
and economic agenda. Second, a trade-off must be operated
between transaction costs and governance costs, the costs of in-
ternalizing transaction costs. In that respect, marketing boards
introduce some rigidities12 in the value chain coordination pro-
cess due to their hierarchical nature, and are facing several
challenges to respond more quickly to market demands. Mar-
keting boards are thus not the optimal economic solution for all
settings.
Our results can bring some useful policy insights, espe-
cially in the context of the current agricultural policy trend in
Europe. European authorities have recently shown a keen inter-
est in contracting as a regulation tool substituting dairy quotas.
If contracting should become the rule in milk transactions co-
ordination, our study suggests that policy makers should design
an institutional framework that will minimize ex post transac-
tion costs faced by farmers since these latter tend to be locked
by the temporal specificity of transactions in their contractual
relations with buyers and have a lower bargaining power. Also,
since negotiation might be more advantageous to buyers for
the same reasons, information on prices and buyer reputation
should be available to producers to choose from the best options
to minimize their transaction costs.
